## Origin of the name

I was struggling to find an available (and cheap) domain name that had any relevance to a URL shortening service.
I recalled that in the German language there is a diminutive form; when adding "chen" to the end of some German nouns,
it transforms them to a smaller / cuter version. For example, a Schwein is a pig but a Schweinchen is a piglet. 

So a Linkchen is a play on words for a smaller / cuter version of a Link.

And luckily, the domain name was available.
